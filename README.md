PROJECT OUTLINE: US Economic Dashboard- The State of the Economy

The goal of this project was to create visualizations of data. Our team chose to investigate the current state of the US economy and it's impact on US citizens. 
We created a website where you are able to select specific dates and see comparisons of unemployment rate and inflation rate vs Misery Index. 

To view this please use *insert link here*

Objective:
•	Develop an overall dashboard that will link to the various sites showing economic data and recent news.  In this website we focused on the Misery Index and a stock search / stock plot creation.

•	Will be extracting various economic data from Quandl using available, free API.  With this data will be constructing various charts and visualizations to communicate the state of the US economy.
•	Plan to utilize Plotl.y for these various visualizations.

•	This site will web scrape the CNBC Economic website for the most recent economic headlines and news stories.  Will include article headline and image.  MongoDb is used to house the web scraping results.

•	Website will be constructed with D3 and JavaScript for these visualizations, news headlines, images, etc.

•	Flask will be the engine developed between the backend and the frontend website.
