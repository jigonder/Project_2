PROJECT OUTLINE: US Economic Dashboard

The goal of this project was to create visualizations of data. Our team chose to investigate the current state of the US economy and it's impact on US citizens. 
We created a website where you are able to select specific dates and see comparisons of unemployment rate and inflation rate vs Misery Index.
